      - Maintaining aspect ratio while upscaling to each target dimension.
      - Ensuring 300 DPI resolution for all sizes.
      - Applying HDR and sharpness enhancements for optimal print quality.
      - Verifying image quality and dimensions for each size.
    Each size will be processed with professional print standards and saved with a clear size indicator in the filename.

create_mockups:
  description: >
    Generate high-fidelity product mockups that showcase the digital art in realistic, marketable contexts.

      - Use the URL of the image from the image_generator's output directly.
      - Include detailed instructions for positioning, perspective, and environmental lighting to enhance realism.
    Do not use any sandbox or placeholder images - only use the actual generated image from the previous step.

    detailing the context (e.g., indoor, outdoor, framed, unframed) and any applied transformations.

      - All relevant images (printable PNG, PDF, and mockups) with their associated metadata.
      - Pricing suggestions if applicable, and any additional details needed for Etsy's platform.
    The final output should be a structured JSON object suitable for direct integration with the Etsy API.
    IMPORTANT: Save the complete listing information as a JSON file named "listing.json" in the output directory.
    To save the JSON data, use the JSON Save Tool with the following format:
      - Pass the listing data directly as a dictionary (not as a string)
      - Use "listing.json" as the filename (do not include "output/" in the filename)
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive JSON object containing:
      - "title": optimized title,
      - "description": detailed listing description,
      - "tags": array of SEO-friendly tags,

      - "assets": { "printable": file links, "pdf": file links, "mockups": file links },
